# What is the role of the blog?


This blog will have a variety of different uses. Some entries will be to publish Bohmian news such as new articles, books, and events.

Other entries will be reviews of books and articles.

A third category of entries will be more of a FAQ.

A final category is that of speculative ideas. While publishing is a good thing, when trying to come to terms with the way the world is, sharing is a good thing. In that spirit, some ideas may be put out here for comment and to inspire others.

The ideas posted here are fair game to be pursued if they inspire you. Appropriate attribution is expected.
