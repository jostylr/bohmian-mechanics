# One Dimensional Spaces

We will start with a refreshing journey over typical topics in an introductory quantum mechanics course and perhaps push the boundaries of that. 

## Free Particle

Two gaussian packets, speeding away with a slower one being overtaken. The particles switch packets in one dimension. A measurement of momentum (distance from center)/time would lead to the momentums being given the wrong attribution at the beginning. Measurements need to be understood as to what they are really measuring.   

## Harmonic Oscillator

## Square Wells

## Delta-Function Potential

## 1-D Scattering

## Tunneling
