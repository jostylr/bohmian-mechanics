# Vector Bundles

To appreciate Bohmian mechanics, one needs to appreciate the quantum mechanical wave function. Indeed, much of the objection to Bohmian mechanics seems to be centered on objecting to taking the wave function seriously.

To understand the role of the wave function in theory formation, one should think of it as a section of a vector bundle. This section explains this concept and details its use in Bohmian mechanics, particularly with regards to the role of spin.
