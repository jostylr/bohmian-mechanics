# The Minimum Bohmian Basics

In the rest of this part of the book, we will go over routine quantum mechanics from a Bohmian perspective. In order to have this make sense, there are a few basic ideas that we need to accept. The later parts of the book will go into more detail of the meaning and reason for these deep aspects of Bohmian mechanics, but we shall start by just using them. 

## Particles

This is a theory about particles with positions. If a particle exists, it has a position. That is what we mean by a particle. 

This needs to be accepted as a fundamental starting point of the theory. The goal of the theory is to describe the motion of those particles in space-time. 

## Configuration Space

In standard quantum mechanics, there is a habit to think of the wavefunction as equally representable in any convenient basis. It is thought of as just an element in an abstract Hilbert space that is built out of some kind of physically relevant machinery. 

In Bohmian mechanics, this is not true. Wavefunctions are functions on the configuration space of the particles. For the Schrödinger equation, they must be differentiable in order to provide the velocity field for the Bohmian particles.

So we need to be comfortabl with `\psi(q_1, q_2, q_3, \ldots, q_n)`$ as something fundamental. The Fourier transform of `\psi`$ may be helpful in solving the equations, but it is not relevant in the formulation of the theory. Ultimately, we want a velocity field on configuration space.  

## Wavefunction of a Subsystem

In typical quantum presentations, small systems are presented that end up getting entangled. But fundamentally, there are no small systems. There is only the universal wavefunction governing the whole of the universe's particles. This is what is in the theory itself. 

Now it happens, as we will explain when discussing the full formalism, that Bohmian mechanics has the property that there are situations in which it can be reasonable to approximate the evolution of a set of particles by a wavefunction on that smaller configuration space evolving according to its own Schrödinger equation. 

While this may seem similar to classical mecahnics where, say, the gravitational force of the fly on the apple can be ignored when computing the motion of the apple falling towards the ground, it is, in fact, quite different. Classically, the ideas was that the force on the apple is a sum of all these different forces acting on it and most of those forces are very negligible. 

In Bohmian mechanics, there is no such clear separation from the start. Indeed, the full extent of the wavefunction cannot be approximated in any meaningful way in terms of subsystems.

What is the key component, and ultimately is the source of the apparent collapse of the subssytem wavefunction, is that the environment serves as a localization for a subsystem, whenever it applies. That is, we get subsystems by doing a partial evaluation of the wavefunction. 

So in some of our considerations, we need to justify why we have a subsystem rather than how a system gets entangled. 

That is `\Psi`$, the universal wavefunction is preeminent and `\psi`$, the subsystem wavefunction is what needs to be deduced.
