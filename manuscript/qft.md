# Quantum Field Theories

Quantum mechanics did not last long on its own. Quantum field theories quickly arose and yet Bohmian mechanics seems to focus on quantum mechanics. Why? 

Well, we do have Bohmian-style quantum field theory extensions. 

Instead of building up from vacuum, we again think of the wavefunctions as functions on a configuration space, one of a union of configurations of different size.

## Well-defined QFT

One of the primary problems facing Bohmian mechanics going to quantum field theories is the ill-defined wave dynamics of QFT. But Bohmian ideas may lead to a solution to that -- holistic Hamiltonians that take into account the probability flowing from one sector to another. This prevents the divergences...
