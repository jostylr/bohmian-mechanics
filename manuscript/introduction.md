# Introduction to Bohmian Mechanics

Bohmian mechanics is the infamous theory of quantum theory that is readily
understood, easy to analyze, and in complete agreement with the predictions of
quantum mechanics.

At this site, we will explore what this theory is, how it solves many
problems, the challenges yet to be overcome, and why it is rejected by the
mainstream physics community when, in fact, it solves the most bedeviling
problems in the most obvious and ordinary of ways.

For nontechnical readers, try the gentle introduction to Bohmian mechanics.
This is also a great introduction to quantum mechanics without the mysticism.

## What is Bohmian Mechanics? 

In short, it is a quantum theory of motion concerning particles. Each particle
has a position at all times and the evolution of those positions is governed
by the usual quantum wave function.



All else that follows is from analysis, not further assumptions.
