# Chemistry

Discussion about standard chemistry facts from a Bohmian perspective. Probably not too much to add.

## Photon emission

## Orbitals, spin up, down

## Trajectory Solution Methods

One surprising fact is that chemists use Bohmian ideas to try and solve certain situations, those in which spin is not relevant.
