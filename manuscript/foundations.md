# Foundations

Bohmian mechanics is easily derived from a variety of directions. It can be extended in many directions. And it explains many basic tenets of quantum mechanics which are otherwise obscure.

The basic idea that runs through the quantum formalism and Bohmian mechanics is that there is a special probability current associated with the wave function and its evolution. That current is taken to form the basis of the Bohmian motion.

When searching for extensions to the theory, we use that to write down generalizations of the simple Bohmian motion. We should also note that as the probability current is all that matters, any motion which does preserve that current (and there are multiple ones) would be fine to use. Indeed, the non-relativistic limit of the Bohm-Dirac motion leads to a slightly different law of motion than the one presented here.

## Derivations of Bohmian Mechanics

Where does Bohmian mechanics come from? Is it contrived or is it natural?

## Recnciling Relativity and Bohmian Mechanics 

Bohmian mechanics is a nonlocal theory; how does that work with relativity?

## Generalizations of Bohmian Mechanics

How is spin dealt with? Quantum mechanics has issues with generalizations to manifolds; does Bohmian mechanics?

## Identical Particles

The lack of trajectories in quantum mechanics leads to identical particles, yes? How can that be compatible with Bohmian mechanics?

## Creation and Annihilation of Particles

Can we model the creation and annihilation of particles in Bohmian mechanics? How can we have a wave function of indeterminate number of particles? Is not the randomness of the creation of particles anathema?
